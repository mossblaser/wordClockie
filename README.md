Word Clockie
============

Word clockie is a spiritual successor to
[Clockie](http://jhnet.co.uk/projects/clockie) which I made my then-girlfriend
Ann-Marie to count down to the next time we would meet while living a fair
distance apart. Three years later and we're married and living together and
Clockie has become sadly a little redundant. With our first anniversary coming
up, Word Clockie is an attempt to reinvent Clockie with a little more polish and
a more fitting purpose of counting our time together.

With the soppy bit out of the way, Word Clockie is, unsurprisingly, is a word
clock. These clocks consist of a matrix of letters or words which are lit up to
spell out sentences describing the current time. Following the [surprisingly
recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ko9CeylUTs) discovery that [easily
sourced LED
matrices](http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR11.TRC1.A0.Xwedding+place+cards&_nkw=led+matrix&_sacat=0&_from=R40)
solve the traditionally hard problem of building large LED arrays with nicely
defused light without leaking between LEDS it seemed like a good excuse to build
one.  Word clocks have of course been [done to
death](hackaday.com/?s=word+clock) but in spite of this Word Clockie hopefully
has a handful of fun twists not shared by other offerings.
